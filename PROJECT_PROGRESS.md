# Project Progress

This document outlines the completed tasks and the tasks that are yet to be done for this project.

## Completed Tasks

- **Project Structure**: Set up the basic project structure with React, Vite, and Supabase.
- **Authentication Form**: Created the authentication form (`AuthForm.tsx`) with fields for email, password, full name, company name, and phone number.
- **Supabase Integration**: Integrated Supabase for user authentication (sign-up and sign-in).
- **User Profiles Table**: Created a `profiles` table in the database to store user information (`full_name`, `company_name`, `phone_number`).
- **Database Trigger**: Implemented a database trigger (`handle_new_user`) that automatically populates the `profiles` table when a new user signs up in `auth.users`.
- **Phone Number Field**: Added a phone number field to the sign-up form and configured it to be saved to the database.
- **Payment Section**: Resolved the payment section with complete integration including:
  - Payment page (`PaymentPage.tsx`)
  - Payment form (`PaymentForm.tsx`) with Stripe integration
  - Payment processor (`PaymentProcessor.tsx`) for handling payment states
  - Complete flow from pricing to payment processing

## Tasks to be Done

- **Improve UI/UX**: Enhance the design and user experience of the following pages:
  - Login page
  - Registration page
- **Payment-First Workflow**: Implement a workflow where the user account is created *after* a successful payment.
- **Webhook Integration**: Upon successful account creation (after payment), send the user data to a specified webhook URL. This will be used to grant access to the application.
